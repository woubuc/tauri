# Changelog

## \[1.0.0-beta.5]

  - [e3f99165](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/commit/e3f9916526b226866137cb663e5cafab2b6a0e01) fix(core) minHeight being used as maxHeight ([#2247](https://www.github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/pull/2247)) on 2021-07-19

## \[1.0.0-beta.4]

- `Params` has been removed, along with all the associated types on it. Functions that previously accepted those
  associated types now accept strings instead. Type that used a generic parameter `Params` now use `Runtime` instead. If
  you use the `wry` feature, then types with a `Runtime` generic parameter should default to `Wry`, letting you omit the
  explicit type and let the compiler infer it instead.

`tauri`:

- See `Params` note
- If you were using `Params` inside a function parameter or definition, all references to it have been replaced with a
  simple runtime that defaults to `Wry`. If you are not using a custom runtime, just remove `Params` from the definition
  of functions/items that previously took it. If you are using a custom runtime, you *may* need to pass the runtime type
  to these functions.
- If you were using custom types for `Params` (uncommon and if you don't understand you probably were not using it), all
  methods that were previously taking the custom type now takes an `Into<String>` or a `&str`. The types were already
  required to be string-able, so just make sure to convert it into a string before passing it in if this breaking change
  affects you.

`tauri-macros`:

- (internal) Added private `default_runtime` proc macro to allow us to give item definitions a custom runtime only when
  the specified feature is enabled.

`tauri-runtime`:

- See `Params` note
- Removed `Params`, `MenuId`, `Tag`, `TagRef`.
- Added `menu::{MenuHash, MenuId, MenuIdRef}` as type aliases for the internal type that menu types now use.
  - All previous menu items that had a `MenuId` generic now use the underlying `MenuId` type without a generic.
- `Runtime`, `RuntimeHandle`, and `Dispatch` have no more generic parameter on `create_window(...)` and instead use the
  `Runtime` type directly
- `Runtime::system_tray` has no more `MenuId` generic and uses the string based `SystemTray` type directly.
- (internal) `CustomMenuItem::id_value()` is now hashed on creation and exposed as the `id` field with type `MenuHash`.

`tauri-runtime-wry`:

- See `Params` note
- update menu and runtime related types to the ones changed in `tauri-runtime`.

`tauri-utils`:

- `Assets::get` signature has changed to take a `&AssetKey` instead of `impl Into<AssetKey>` to become trait object
  safe.
